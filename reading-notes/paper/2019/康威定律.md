Author's note 42 years after publication: Perhaps this paper's most remarkable feature is that it made it to publication with its thesis statement in the third\-last paragraph. To save you the trouble of wading through 45 paragraphs to find the thesis, I'll give an informal version of it to you now: Any organization that designs a system (defined more broadly here than just information systems) will inevitably produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure. This turns out to be a principle with much broader utility than in software engineering, where references to it usually occur. I invite you to read the paper, then look around to find applications. My current favorite is the complex of social issues encompassing poverty in America: access to labor markets, housing, education, and health care. After reading the paper, think about how the structures of our various governments affect their approaches to this system.

How Do Committees Invent?

That kind of intellectual activity which creates a whole from its diverse parts may be called the design of a system. Whether the particular activity is the creation of specifications for a major weapon system, the formation of a recommendation to meet a social challenge, or the programming of a computer, the general activity is largely the same.

> 这种从不同的部分创造出一个整体的智力活动可以称为系统的设计。无论特定活动是武器系统指定规范, 形成满足社会挑战的建议，还是计算机编程，一般活动大致相同。

Typically, the objective of a design organization is the creation and assembly of a document containing a coherently structured body of information. We may name this information the system design. It is typically produced for a sponsor who usually desires to carry out some activity guided by the system design. For example, a public official may wish to propose legislation to avert a recurrence of a recent disaster, so he appoints a team to explain the catastrophe. Or a manufacturer needs a new product and designates a product planning activity to specify what should be introduced.

> 通常，设计组织的目标是创建和组装包含连贯结构化信息体的文档。 我们可以将此信息命名为系统设计。 它通常是为赞助商制作的，他们通常希望在系统设计的指导下进行一些活动。 例如，公职人员可能希望提出立法以避免最近再次发生灾难，因此他任命一个团队来解释灾难。 或者制造商需要新产品并指定产品计划活动以指定应引入的内容。

The design organization may or may not be involved in the construction of the system it designs. Frequently, in public affairs, there are policies which discourage a group's acting upon its own recommendations, whereas, in private industry, quite the opposite situation often prevails.

> 设计组织可能会或可能不会参与其设计的系统的构建。 通常，在公共事务中，有些政策会阻止一个集团根据自己的建议采取行动，而在私营企业中，通常会出现相反的情况。

It seems reasonable to suppose that the knowledge that one will have to carry out one's own recommendations or that this task will fall to others, probably affects some design choices which the individual designer is called upon to make. Most design activity requires continually making choices, Many of these choices may be more than design decisions; they may also be personal decisions the designer makes about his own future. As we shall see later, the incentives which exist in a conventional management environment can motivate choices which subvert the intent of the sponsor.\[1\]

> 假设一个人必须执行自己的建议或者这个任务将落入其他人的知识似乎是合理的，这可能会影响个人设计师要求做出的一些设计选择。 大多数设计活动需要不断做出选择，其中许多选择可能不仅仅是设计决策; 他们也可能是设计师对自己未来的个人决定。 正如我们稍后将看到的，**传统管理环境中存在的激励可以激发颠覆赞助者意图的选择。**

Stages of Design

> 设计阶段

The initial stages of a design effort are concerned more with structuring of the design activity than with the system itself.\[2\] The full\-blown design activity cannot proceed until certain preliminary milestones are passed. These include:

> 设计工作的初始阶段更多地关注设计活动的结构而不是系统本身。在完成某些初步里程碑之前，完整的设计活动无法进行。这些包括:

1. Understanding of the boundaries, both on the design activity and on the system to be designed, placed by the sponsor and by the world's realities,

> 了解设计活动和设计系统的界限，由赞助商和世界的现实，

2. Achievement of a preliminary notion of the system's organization so that design task groups can be meaningfully assigned.

> 实现系统组织的初步概念，以便可以有意义地分配设计任务组。

We shall see in detail later that the very act of organizing a design team means that certain design decisions have already been made, explicitly or otherwise. Given any design team organization, there is a class of design alternatives which cannot be effectively pursued by such an organization because the necessary communication paths do not exist. Therefore, there is no such thing as a design group which is both organized and unbiased.

> 稍后我们将详细说明组织设计团队的行为意味着已经明确或以其他方式做出了某些设计决策。 鉴于任何设计团队组织，有一类设计替代方案，这种组织无法有效追求，因为不存在必要的通信路径。 因此，不存在一个既有组织又无偏见的设计小组。

Once the organization of the design team is chosen, it is possible to delegate activities to the subgroups of the organization. Every time a delegation is made and somebody's scope of inquiry is narrowed, the class of design alternatives which can be effectively pursued is also narrowed.

> 一旦选择了设计团队的组织，就可以将活动委派给组织的子组。 每次制定一个代表团并缩小某个人的调查范围时，也可以缩小可以有效追求的设计方案。

Once scopes of activity are defined, a coordination problem is created. Coordination among task groups, although it appears to lower the productivity of the individual in the small group, provides the only possibility that the separate task groups will be able to consolidate their efforts into a unified system design.

> 一旦定义了活动范围，就会存在协调问题。 任务组之间的协调虽然似乎降低了小组中个人的生产力，但却提供了单独任务组能够将其工作整合到统一系统设计中的唯一可能性。

Thus the life cycle of a system design effort proceeds through the following general stages.

> 因此，系统设计工作的生命周期通过以下一般阶段进行。

1. Drawing of boundaries according to the ground rules.

> 1.根据基本规则绘制边界。

2. Choice of a preliminary system concept.

> 2.选择初步的系统概念。

3. Organization of the design activity and delegation of tasks according to that concept.

> 3.根据该概念组织设计活动和任务授权。

4. Coordination among delegated tasks.

> 4.委派任务之间的协调。

5. Consolidation of subdesigns into a single design.

> 5.将子设计合并为单一设计。

It is possible that a given design activity will not proceed straight through this list. It might conceivably reorganize upon discovery of a new, and obviously superior, design concept; but such an appearance of uncertainty is unflattering, and the very act of voluntarily abandoning a creation is painful and expensive. Of course, from the vantage point of the historian, the process is continually repeating. This point of view has produced the observation that there's never enough time to do something right, but there's always enough time to do it over.

> 给定的设计活动可能不会直接通过此列表。 可以想象，在发现一种新的，明显优越的设计概念后，它可能会重新组织起来; 但是这种不确定的表现并不令人讨厌，而且自愿放弃创作的行为既痛苦又昂贵。 当然，从历史学家的角度来看，这个过程在不断重复。 这种观点产生了观察，即没有足够的时间做正确的事情，但总有足够的时间来完成它。

The Designed System

> 系统设计

Any system of consequence is structured from smaller subsystems which are interconnected. A description of a system, if it is to describe what goes on inside that system, must describe the system's connections to the outside world, and it must delineate each of the subsystems and how they are interconnected. Dropping down one level, we can say the same for each of the subsystems, viewing it as a system. This reduction in scope can continue until we are down to a system which is simple enough to be understood without further subdivision.

> 任何后果系统都是由相互连接的较小子系统构成的。 如果要描述系统内部的内容，系统的描述必须描述系统与外部世界的连接，并且必须描述每个子系统以及它们如何互连。 降低一个级别，我们可以对每个子系统说同样的事情，将其视为一个系统。 范围的缩小可以持续到我们进入一个简单到足以被理解而没有进一步细分的系统。

Examples. A transcontinental public transportation system consists of buses, trains, airplanes, various types of right\-of\-way, parking lots, taxicabs, terminals, and so on. This is a very heterogeneous system; that is, the subsystems are quite diverse. Dropping down one level, an airplane, for example. may possess subsystems for structure, propulsion, power distribution, communication, and payload packaging. The propulsion subsystem has fuel, ignition, and starting subsystems, to name a few.

> 例子。 横贯大陆的公共交通系统包括公共汽车，火车，飞机，各种类型的权利，停车场，出租车，终端等。 这是一个非常异构的系统; 也就是说，子系统非常多样化。 例如，降低一级，一架飞机。 可能拥有用于结构，推进，配电，通信和有效载荷包装的子系统。 推进子系统具有燃料，点火和启动子系统，仅举几例。

It may be less obvious that a theory is a system in the same sense. It relates to the outside world of observed events where it must explain, or at least not contradict, them. It consists of subtheories which must relate to each other in the same way. For example, the investigation of an airplane crash attempts to produce a theory explaining a complex event. It can consist of subtheories describing the path of the aircraft, its radio communications, the manner of its damage, and its relationship to nearby objects at the time of the event. Each of these, in turn, is a story in itself which can be further broken down into finer detail down to the level of individual units of evidence.

> 理论是一个同样意义上的系统可能不太明显。 它涉及观察事件的外部世界，它必须解释或至少不与它们相矛盾。 它由子理论组成，它们必须以相同的方式相互关联。 例如，对飞机失事的调查试图产生一个解释复杂事件的理论。 它可以包括描述飞机路径，无线电通信，其损坏方式以及它在事件发生时与附近物体的关系的子理论。 反过来，这些中的每一个本身都是一个故事，可以进一步细分为更细致的细节，直至各个证据单元的水平。

Linear graphs. Fig. 1 illustrates this view of a system as a linear graph \-\- a Tinker\-Toy structure with branches (the lines) and nodes (the circles). Each node is a subsystem which communicates with other subsystems along the branches. In turn, each subsystem may contain a structure which may be similarly portrayed. The term interface, which is becoming popular among systems people, refers to the inter\-subsystem communication path or branch represented by a line in Fig. 1. Alternatively, the interface is the plug or flange by which the path coming out of one node couples to the path coming out of another node.

> 线性图。 图1示出了系统的这种视图作为线性图 - 具有分支（线）和节点（圆圈）的Tinker-Toy结构。 每个节点都是一个子系统，它与分支机构的其他子系统通信。 反过来，每个子系统可以包含可以类似地描绘的结构。 术语接口在系统人员中变得流行，是指图1中由线路表示的子系统间通信路径或分支。或者，接口是插头或法兰，来自一个节点的路径耦合在一起 从另一个节点出来的路径。

Figure 1

Relating the Two

The linear\-graph notation is useful because it provides an abstraction which has the same form for the two entities we are considering: the design organization and the system it designs. This can be illustrated in Fig. 1 by replacing the following words.

> 线性图表符号很有用，因为它提供了一个抽象，它与我们正在考虑的两个实体具有相同的形式：设计组织和它设计的系统。 这可以通过替换以下单词在图1中示出。

1. Replace "system" by "committee."

> 1.将“系统”改为“委员会”。

2. Replace "subsystem" by "subcommittee."

> 2.将“子系统”替换为“小组委员会”。

3. Replace "interface" by "coordinator."

> 3.将“接口”替换为“协调”。

Just as with systems, we find that design groups can be viewed at several levels of complication. The Federal Government, for example. is an excellent example of a design organization with enough complexity to satisfy any system engineer. This is a particularly interesting example for showing the similarity of the two concepts being studied here because the Federal Government is both a design organization (designing laws, treaties, and policies) and a designed system (the Constitution being the principal preliminary design document).

> 与系统一样，我们发现可以在多个复杂程度上查看设计组。 例如，联邦政府。 是设计组织的一个很好的例子，其复杂性足以满足任何系统工程师的需求。 这是展示这里研究的两个概念的相似性的一个特别有趣的例子，因为联邦政府既是设计组织（设计法律，条约和政策），也是设计系统（宪法是主要的初步设计文件）。

A basic relationship. We are now in a position to address the fundamental question of this article. Is there any predictable relationship between the graph structure of a design organization and the graph structure of the system it designs? The answer is: Yes, the relationship is so simple that in some cases it is an identity. Consider the following "proof."

> 基本关系。 我们现在能够解决本文的基本问题。 设计组织的图形结构与其设计的系统的图形结构之间是否存在可预测的关系？ 答案是：是的，这种关系非常简单，在某些情况下它是一种身份。 考虑以下“证据”。

Let us choose arbitrarily some system and the organization which designed it, and let us then choose equally arbitrarily some level of complication of the designed system for which we can draw a graph. (Our motivation for this arbitrariness is that if we succeed in demonstrating anything interesting, it will hold true for any design organization and level of complication.) Fig. 2 shows, for illustration purposes only, a structure to which the following statements may be related.

> 让我们任意选择一些系统和设计它的组织，然后让我们随意选择设计系统的一些复杂程度，我们可以绘制图形。 （我们对这种任意性的动机是，如果我们成功地展示了任何有趣的东西，它将适用于任何设计组织和复杂程度。）图2仅出于说明目的，显示了以下陈述可能与之相关的结构。

![](http://www.melconway.com/Home/Committees_Paper_files/commfig2.gif)

Figure 2

For any node x in the system we can identify a design group of the design organization which designed x; call this X. Therefore, by generalization of this process, for every node of the system we have a rule for finding a corresponding node of the design organization. Notice that this rule is not necessarily one\-to\-one; that is, the two subsystems might have been designed by a single design group.

> 对于系统中的任何节点x，我们可以识别设计x的设计组织的设计组; 因此，通过该过程的概括，对于系统的每个节点，我们都有一个规则来查找设计组织的相应节点。 请注意，此规则不一定是一对一的; 也就是说，这两个子系统可能是由一个设计组设计的。

Interestingly, we can make a similar statement about branches. Take any two nodesx and y of the system. Either they are joined by a branch or they are not. (That is, either they communicate with each other in some way meaningful to the operation of the system or they do not.) If there is a branch, then the two (not necessarily distinct) design groups X and Y which designed the two nodes must have negotiated and agreed upon an interface specification to permit communication between the two corresponding nodes of the design organization. If, on the other hand, there is no branch between x and y, then the subsystems do not communicate with each other, there was nothing for the two corresponding design groups to negotiate, and therefore there is no branch between X and Y.\[3\]

> 有趣的是，我们可以对分支做出类似的陈述。 取系统的任意两个节点x和y。 要么他们是由一个分支加入，要么他们不是。 （也就是说，要么它们以某种方式相互通信，对系统的操作有意义，要么它们没有。）如果有分支，那么设计两个节点的两个（不一定是不同的）设计组X和Y 必须协商并商定接口规范，以允许设计组织的两个相应节点之间的通信。 另一方面，如果x和y之间没有分支，则子系统不相互通信，两个相应的设计组没有任何协商，因此X和Y之间没有分支。

What have we just shown? Roughly speaking, we have demonstrated that there is a very close relationship between the structure of a system and the structure of the organization which designed it. In the not unusual case where each subsystem had its own separate design group, we find that the structures (i.e., the linear graphs) of the design group and the system are identical. In the case where some group designed more than one subsystem we find that the structure of the design organization is a collapsed version of the structure of the system, with the subsystems having the same design group collapsing into one node representing that group.

> 我们刚刚展示了什么？ 粗略地说，我们已经证明了系统结构与设计它的组织结构之间存在非常密切的关系。 在每个子系统都有自己独立设计组的非常规情况下，我们发现设计组和系统的结构（即线性图）是相同的。 在某些组设计了多个子系统的情况下，我们发现设计组织的结构是系统结构的折叠版本，具有相同设计组的子系统折叠成表示该组的一个节点。

This kind of a structure\-preserving relationship between two sets of things is called a homomorphism. Speaking as a mathematician might, we would say that there is a homomorphism from the linear graph of a system to the linear graph of its design organization.

> 这两种事物之间的这种结构保持关系称为同态。 作为一个数学家，我们可以说，从系统的线性图到其设计组织的线性图有一个同态。

Systems Image Their Design Groups

> 系统图像他们的设计组

It is an article of faith among experienced, system designers that given any system design, someone someday will find a better one to do the same job. In other words, it is misleading and incorrect to speak of the design for a specific job, unless this is understood in the context of space, time, knowledge, and technology. The humility which this belief should impose on system designers is the only appropriate posture for those who read history or consult their memories

> 对于经验丰富的系统设计师来说，这是一篇信条，在任何系统设计的基础上，总有人会找到一个更好的人来做同样的工作。 换句话说，除非在空间，时间，知识和技术的背景下理解这一点，否则谈论特定工作的设计是误导和错误的。 这种信念应该对系统设计者施加的谦逊是那些阅读历史或查阅记忆的人唯一合适的姿势

The design progress of computer translators of programming languages such as F0RTRAN and COBOL is a case in point. In the middle fifties, when the prototypes of these languages appeared, their compilers were even more cumbersome objects than the giant (for then) computers which were required for their execution. Today, these translators are only historical curiosities, bearing no resemblance in design to today's compilers. (We should take particular note of the fact that the quantum jumps in compiler design progress were associated with the appearance of new groups of people on territory previously trampled chiefly by computer manufacturers \-\- first it was the tight little university research team, followed by the independent software house.)

> 编程语言（如F0RTRAN和COBOL）的计算机翻译器的设计进展就是一个很好的例子。 在五十年代中期，当这些语言的原型出现时，他们的编译器比那些执行所需的巨型计算机（当时的计算机）更加繁琐。 今天，这些翻译只是历史的好奇心，与今天的编译器在设计上没有任何相似之处。 （我们应该特别注意这样一个事实，即编译器设计进度中的量子跳跃与先前被计算机制造商主要践踏的新人群的出现相关联 - 首先是紧张的小型大学研究团队，其次是 独立软件公司。）

If, then, it is reasonable to assume that for any system requirement there is a family of system designs which will meet that requirement, we must also inquire whether the choice of design organization influences the process of selection of a system design from that family. If we believe our homomorphism, then we must agree that it does. To the extent that an organization is not completely flexible in its communication structure, that organization will stamp out an image of itself in every design it produces. The larger an organization is, the less flexibility it has and the more pronounced is the phenomenon.

> 那么，如果有理由认为，对于任何系统要求，有一系列系统设计将满足该要求，我们还必须询问设计组织的选择是否影响从该系列中选择系统设计的过程。 如果我们相信我们的同态，那么我们必须同意它。 如果组织的通信结构不够灵活，那么该组织将在其生成的每个设计中标出自己的图像。 组织越大，其灵活性越低，现象就越明显。

Examples. A contract research organization had eight people who were to produce a COBOL and an ALGOL compiler. After some initial estimates of difficulty and time, five people were assigned to the COBOL job and three to the ALGOL job. The resulting COBOL compiler ran in five phases, the ALG0L compiler ran in three.

> 例子。 一个合同研究组织有八个人要生产一个COBOL和一个ALGOL编译器。 经过一些初步的难度和时间估算后，有5人被分配到COBOL工作，3人被分配到ALGOL工作。 生成的COBOL编译器分五个阶段运行，ALG0L编译器运行三个阶段。

Two military services were directed by their Commander\-in\-Chief to develop a common weapon system to meet their respective needs. After great effort they produced a copy of their organization chart. (See Fig. 3a.)

> 他们的总司令指示两个军事部门发展共同武器系统，以满足他们各自的需要。 经过努力，他们制作了一份组织结构图。 （见图3a。）

Figure 3

Consider the operating computer system in use solving a problem. At a high level of examination, it consists of three parts: the hardware, the system software, and the application program. (See Fig. 3b.) Corresponding to these subsystems are their respective designers: the computer manufacturer's engineers, his system programmers, and the user's application programmers. (Those rare instances where the system hardware and software tend to cooperate rather than merely tolerate each other are associated with manufacturers whose programmers and engineers bear a similar relationship.)

> 考虑使用中的操作计算机系统解决问题。 在高水平的检查中，它由三部分组成：硬件，系统软件和应用程序。 （参见图3b。）对应于这些子系统的是各自的设计者：计算机制造商的工程师，他的系统程序员和用户的应用程序员。 （系统硬件和软件倾向于合作而不是仅仅相互容忍的罕见情况与程序员和工程师具有类似关系的制造商有关。）

System Management

The structures of large systems tend to disintegrate during development, qualitatively more so than with small systems. This observation is strikingly evident when applied to the large military information systems of the last dozen years; These are some of the most complex objects devised by the mind of man. An activity called "system management" has sprung up partially in response to this tendency of systems to disintegrate. Let us examine the utility to system management of the concepts we have developed here.

> 大型系统的结构倾向于在开发过程中分解，在质量上比小型系统更为分散。 当应用于过去十几年的大型军事信息系统时，这一观察非常明显; 这些是人类思想设计的一些最复杂的对象。 一种称为“系统管理”的活动如雨后春笋般涌现，以应对这种系统崩溃的趋势。 让我们来看看我们在这里开发的概念对系统管理的效用。

Why do large systems disintegrate? The process seems to occur in three steps, the first two of which are controllable and the third of which is a direct result of our homomorphism.

> 为什么大型系统会瓦解？ 这个过程似乎分三个步骤发生，前两个是可控制的，第三个步骤是我们同态的直接结果。

1.  •First, the realization by the initial designers that the system will be large, together with certain pressures in their organization, make irresistible the temptation to assign too many people to a design effort.

> 首先，初始设计者认识到系统将是庞大的，加上组织中的某些压力，使得太多人分配给设计工作的诱惑变得不可抗拒。

2.  •Second, application of the conventional wisdom of management to a large design organization causes its communication structure to disintegrate.

> 其次，将传统的管理智慧应用于大型设计组织会导致其沟通结构瓦解。

3.  •Third, the homomorphism insures that the structure of the system will reflect the disintegration which has occurred in the design organization.

> 第三，同态性确保系统的结构将反映设计组织中发生的分裂。

Let us first examine the tendency to overpopulate a design effort. It is a natural temptation of the initial designer \-\- the one whose preliminary design concepts influence the organization of the design effort \-\- to delegate tasks when the apparent complexity of the system approaches his limits of comprehension. This is the turning point in the course of the design. Either he struggles to reduce the system to comprehensibility and wins, or else he loses control of it. The outcome is almost predictable if there is schedule pressure and a budget to be managed.

> 让我们首先考察一下设计工作人数过多的趋势。 这是初始设计师的自然诱惑 - 初步设计概念影响设计工作的组织 - 当系统的明显复杂性接近他的理解极限时委派任务。 这是设计过程中的转折点。 **要么他努力将系统降低到可理解性并获胜，否则他就会失去对它的控制。 如果有进度压力和预算管理，结果几乎可以预测。**

A manager knows that he will be vulnerable to the charge of mismanagement if he misses his schedule without having applied all his resources. This knowledge creates a strong pressure on the initial designer who might prefer to wrestle with the design rather than fragment it by delegation, but he is made to feel that the cost of risk is too high to take the chance. Therefore, he is forced to delegate in order to bring more resources to bear.

> 一位经理知道，如果他在没有运用所有资源的情况下错过了他的日程安排，他将容易受到管理不善的影响。 这种知识给最初的设计师带来了巨大的压力，他们可能更倾向于与设计搏斗，而不是通过授权将其分解，但他觉得风险成本太高而无法抓住机会。 因此，他被迫委托，以便带来更多的资源。

The following case illustrates another but related way in which the environment of the manager can be in conflict with the integrity of the system being designed.

> 以下案例说明了另一种但相关的方式，其中管理者的环境可能与正在设计的系统的完整性相冲突。

A manager must subcontract a crucial and difficult design task. He has a choice of two contractors, a small new organization which proposes an intuitively appealing approach for much less money than is budgeted, and an established but conventional outfit which is asking a more "realistic" fee. He knows that if the bright young organization fails to produce adequate results, he will be accused of mismanagement, whereas if the established outfit fails, it will be evidence that the problem is indeed a difficult one.

> 经理必须分包一项至关重要且困难的设计任务。 他可以选择两个承包商，一个小型新组织，提出一种直观吸引人的方法，比预算少得多的钱，以及一个既定但传统的服装，要求更“现实”的费用。 他知道，如果这个聪明的年轻组织未能产生足够的结果，他将被指责管理不善，而如果已建立的装备失败，那将证明问题确实是一个困难的问题。

What is the difficulty here? A large part of it relates to the kind of reasoning about measurement of resources which arises from conventional accounting theory. According to this theory, the unit of resource is the dollar, and all resources must be measured using units of measurement which are convertible to the dollar. If the resource is human effort, the unit of measurement is the number of hours worked by each man times his hourly cost, summed up for the whole working force.

> 这有什么困难？ 其中很大一部分涉及传统会计理论产生的关于资源计量的推理。 根据这一理论，资源单位是美元，所有资源必须使用可转换为美元的计量单位来衡量。 如果资源是人力，则计量单位是每个人的工作小时数乘以他的每小时成本，总计为整个劳动力。

One fallacy behind this calculation is the property of linearity which says that two men working for a year or one hundred men working for a week (at the same hourly cost per man) are resources of equal value. Assuming that two men and one hundred men cannot work in the same organizational structure (this is intuitively evident and will be discussed below) our homomorphism says that they will not design similar systems; therefore the value of their efforts may not even be comparable. From experience we know that the two men, if they are well chosen and survive the experience, will give us a better system. Assumptions which may be adequate for peeling potatoes and erecting brick walls fail for designing systems.

> 这种计算背后的一个谬论是线性的特性，即两名工作一年或一百名工作一周的人（每人每小时成本相同）是同等价值的资源。 假设两个人和一百个人不能在同一个组织结构中工作（这是直观明显的，将在下面讨论），我们的同态性说他们不会设计类似的系统; 因此，他们努力的价值甚至可能无法比拟。 根据经验，我们知道，如果两个人都经过精心挑选并在经验中存活下来，那将会给我们一个更好的体系。 对于设计系统而言，可能足以剥离马铃薯和架设砖墙的假设失败。

Parkinson's law\[4\] plays an important role in the overassignment of design effort. As long as the manager's prestige and power are tied to the size of his budget, he will be motivated to expand his organization. This is an inappropriate motive in the management of a system design activity. Once the organization exists, of course, it will be used. Probably the greatest single common factor behind many poorly designed systems now in existence has been the availability of a design organization in need of work.

> 帕金森定律在设计工作的过度分配中起着重要作用。 **只要经理的声望和权力与他的预算规模挂钩，他就会有动力扩展他的组织。** 这是管理系统设计活动的不恰当动机。 当组织存在时，当然会使用它。 现在存在的许多设计不良的系统背后最大的单一共同因素可能是需要工作的设计组织的可用性。

The second step in the disintegration of a system design \-\- the fragmentation of the design organization communication structure \-\- begins as soon as delegation has started. Elementary probability theory tells us that the number of possible communication paths in an organization is approximately half the square of the number of people in the organization. Even in a moderately small organization it becomes necessary to restrict communication in order that people can get some "work" done. Research which leads to techniques permitting more efficient communication among designers will play an extremely important role in the technology of system management.

> 分裂开始后，系统设计解体的第二步 - 设计组织通信结构的碎片化 - 就开始了。 基本概率理论告诉我们，组织中可能的通信路径数量大约是组织中人数的一半。 即使在规模适中的小组织中，也必须限制沟通，以便人们可以完成一些“工作”。 导致允许设计者之间更有效沟通的技术的研究将在系统管理技术中发挥极其重要的作用。

Common management practice places certain numerical constraints on the complexity of the linear graph which represents the administrative structure of a military\-style organization. Specifically, each individual must have at most one superior and at most approximately seven subordinates. To the extent that organizational protocol restricts communication along lines of command, the communication structure of an organization will resemble its administrative structure. This is one reason why military\-style organizations design systems which look like their organization charts.

> 共同管理实践对线性图的复杂性施加了某些数值约束，线性图表示军事组织的行政结构。 具体而言，每个人必须至多有一个上级，最多约七个下属。 如果组织协议限制了沿命令行的通信，组织的通信结构将类似于其管理结构。 这就是为什么军事式组织设计看起来像他们的组织结构图的系统的原因之一。

Conclusion

> 结论

The basic thesis of this article is that organizations which design systems (in the broad sense used here) are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations. We have seen that this fact has important implications for the management of system design. Primarily, we have found a criterion for the structuring of design organizations: a design effort should be organized according to the need for communication.

> 本文的基本论点是，设计系统（广义上使用的）组织被限制为产生设计，这些设计是这些组织的通信结构的副本。 我们已经看到这一事实对系统设计的管理具有重要意义。 首先，我们已经找到了设计组织结构的标准：应根据沟通的需要组织设计工作。

This criterion creates problems because the need to communicate at any time depends on the system concept in effect at that time. Because the design which occurs first is almost never the best possible, the prevailing system concept may need to change. Therefore, flexibility of organization is important to effective design.

> 这个标准产生了问题，因为在任何时候进行通信的需要取决于当时有效的系统概念。 因为首先出现的设计几乎不可能是最好的，所以普遍的系统概念可能需要改变。 因此，组织的灵活性对于有效的设计很重要。

Ways must be found to reward design managers for keeping their organizations lean and flexible. There is need for a philosophy of system design management which is not based on the assumption that adding manpower simply adds to productivity. The development of such a philosophy promises to unearth basic questions about value of resources and techniques of communication which will need to be answered before our system\-building technology can proceed with confidence.

> 必须找到方法来奖励设计经理，使他们的组织保持精益和灵活。 需要一种系统设计管理理念，而不是基于增加人力只会增加生产力的假设。 这种理念的发展有望揭示关于资源价值和沟通技术的基本问题，这些问题需要在我们的系统建设技术充满信心之前得到解决。

时间再多一件事情也不可能做的完美，但总有时间做完一件事情
第三定律
There is a homomorphism from the linear graph of a system to the linear graph of its design organization
线型系统和线型组织架构间有潜在的异质同态特性
第四定律
The structures of large systems tend to disintegrate during development, qualitatively more so than with small systems
大的系统组织总是比小系统更倾向于分解

* 做一个系统设计和代码设计坚持原则:
    1. 单一职责原则
    2. 通过抽象降低系统复杂度
    3. 懂得放弃已有的所有东西
    4. 只保存核心本质, 其他的一切都可以舍弃
    5. 审慎思考当前的东西, 随时准备舍弃

* 为什么会出现这种情况, 感觉核心原因是,"要么他努力将系统降低到可理解性并获胜，否则他就会失去对它的控制。 如果有进度压力和预算管理，结果几乎可以预测。", "只要经理的声望和权力与他的预算规模挂钩，他就会有动力扩展他的组织。"这两句话阐释了真谛. 人的脑力有限, 无法完全承载一个复杂系统, 要是没有能力降低复杂系统性, 就会失去对复杂的控制. 人的贪欲会希望扩张自己的权利.
